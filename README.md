                DATA CLEANING

The project is about practicing getting and cleaning using R. The data is from NOAA's Storm Events Database. It lists major weather-related storm events since 1950. For each event it includes information like the start and end dates, where it happened, associated deaths, injuries, and property damage, and some other characteristics. Each row is a separate event.
